-- Autopairs functionality. Insert pair when typing opening character and go over
-- right character if it is already to cursor's right. Also provides mappings for
-- `<CR>` and `<BS>` to perform extra actions when inside pair.
-- Example usage in Insert mode:
-- - `(` - insert "()" and put cursor between them
-- - `)` when there is ")" to the right - jump over ")" without inserting new one
-- - `<C-v>(` - always insert a single "(" literally. This is useful since
--   'mini.pairs' doesn't provide particularly smart behavior, like auto balancing
Config.later(function()
  vim.pack.add({"https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.pairs"})
  -- Create pairs not only in Insert, but also in Command line mode
  require('mini.pairs').setup({ modes = { command = true } })
end)
